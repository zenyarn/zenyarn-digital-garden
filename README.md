# 🌌 Spaceship

**Astro Spaceship** is a powerful, minimal, and flexible theme designed for turning your Obsidian vault into a beautiful, static website using Astro and TailwindCSS. Whether you're sharing your digital garden, notes, or a Zettelkasten, this theme helps bring your knowledge to the web with elegance and ease.

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 **Obsidian Link and Image Resolution**  
  Seamlessly supports `[[wiki-links]]` and embeds like `![[image.png]]`, just like in Obsidian. No need to manually convert links or media.

- 📝 **Frontmatter Metadata for Publishing**  
  Control visibility, titles, descriptions, tags, and more with simple frontmatter options. Choose what gets published and how it appears.

- 🌲 **Tree Navigation Bar**  
  Navigate your notes with a collapsible file tree that mirrors your vault structure. Makes exploring content intuitive and fast.

- 🗂 **Table of Contents (ToC)**  
  Auto-generated ToC for every page, based on headings in your notes. Helps readers easily jump to sections.

- 🔁 **Links and Backlinks**  
  Display outgoing links and backlinks at the bottom of each note, making your web of notes as interconnected as your vault.
